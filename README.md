# Breadboard
I had to move lately, so there was a lot of sorting going on in order to determine the things to bring and the items to let go off. A few of them are projects that only exist on breadboards in some form, so either I had to stuff them into a box and hope for the best or transfer the designs into a more durable medium. For the ones where I didn't want to design something specific yet, I instead wanted to transfer them directly and for that purpose I made these breadboard analogs so that I could transfer them directly.

There may be more sizes added at a later point, but for now I have added a 400 point version that can be seen below. Power bars on the top and the bottom of the PCB can be linked by soldering in a bridge on the backside, with the gap that has been added to these section you could also choose to cut those off using a pair of pliers.
