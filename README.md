# Breadboard
I had to move lately, so there was a lot of sorting going on in order to determine the things to bring and the items to let go off. A few of them are projects that only exist on breadboards in some form, so either I had to stuff them into a box and hope for the best or transfer the designs into a more durable medium. For the ones where I didn't want to design something specific yet, I instead wanted to transfer them directly and for that purpose I made these breadboard analogs so that I could transfer them directly.

The later added 830 point version of should be perfect for when you've tested individual modules while following the Ben Eater series, both the 8 bit computer as well as the 6502 builds (BE6502 is my version of this). Numbers have been indicated on both sides as well as a near identical layout, this should make transferring the design close to error-free. Use the M3 holes at the center to mount the breadboard PCBs, making it suitable for hanging on a wall etc.

You can have these made at your vendor of choice, mostly by handing the zipped contents of each versions export directory to them (usually referred to as gerber files). If it is possible, I would prefer that you use the links below as that'll give me a discount (allowing me the ability to keep my projects open and available to anyone).
